##yoga-client(front-end)

I have implemented UI using react-bootstrap and added notification functionality using react-toastify. I have also implemented form validation using regular expressions and managed the form fields using the useState hook in React. I have used axios to send HTTP requests.

I have deployed the app on Netlify. Here is the live link:

https://yoga-client-app.netlify.app/

I have Dockerized the front-end(client-side) by creating a Docker container for it.
